12 - Types of scheduler, context switching :
--------------------------------------------

* Context :- Process control block and atrributes of a process is called Context.
* Every process has it's priority number based on that they will execute.

Schedulers :

1. Long-term scheduler : It is responsible to get processes from hard disk to RAM.
2. Short-term scheduler: It is responsible to schedule processes to CPU from RAM.
3. Medium-term scheduler: It is responsible to swap-out low priority processes from RAM to Hard-Disk and swap-in high priority processes from Hard-Disk to RAM.

* Context switching :- Pre-empting low priority process on CPU and scheduling high priority process to RAM. 


13. Various times of a process :
--------------------------------

1. Arrival time :
2. Brust time   : (Also called execution time)
3. Completion time :
4. Turn-around time : Total duration of process in RAM. 
5. Waiting time : Total duration of process in RAM waiting for CPU to execute. 
6. Response time : 
7. I/O time : Total duration of process in RAM waiting for I/O.


14. Types of scheduling algorithms :
------------------------------------

1. Pre-emptive scheduling algorithms     : This will pre-emptive process which is executing by CPU, if high priority process arrives in RAM. 
2. Non-pre-emptive scheduling algorithms : This will not pre-emptive process which is executing by CPU, if high priority process arrives in RAM.

* scheduling algorithms are applied only to process which are in ready state in RAM.


15. SJF scheduling algorithm :
------------------------------
 
* Shortest Job First algorithm (SJF) : It is non pre-emptive scheduling algorithm, It will allocate process to the CPU which has least burst time (execution time)
* Turn-around time = waiting time + Brust time + I/O time 
* Schedule length : Total time spent by Schedulig algorithm to schedule processes
* Schedule length = completion time of last process - arrival time of first process
* Throughput = No of processes completed execution / schedule length


18. Shortest remaining time first scheduling algorithm (SRTF) : 
---------------------------------------------------------------

* It is pre-emptive version of SJF.
* It behaves as SJF when all processes reaches to RAM from Hard-Disk. 

19. Response time explained with example :
------------------------------------------

* Response time : Waiting time of a process untill it get CPU for the first time. 
* In non pre-emptive scheduling algorithm Response time = waiting time of a process, but it is not true in  pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.


25. First come first served scheduling algorithm (FCFS) :
---------------------------------------------------------

* The process which has least arrival time will be scheduled first.
* It is non pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
* It is not a priority based scheduling algorithm (scheduling process does not depend on it's process property).
* In non pre-emptive scheduling algorithm response time = waiting time 
* CPU efficiency = usefull time / total time
