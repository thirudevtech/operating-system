Program vs Process, states of a process :
-----------------------------------------

* For single program/software multiple processes can be created.
* states of a process :
1. New state  
2. Ready state 
3. Running state 
4. I/O state 
5. Terminated state 
6. Suspend ready state 
7. Suspend wait state

Degree of multi-programming :
-----------------------------

* Degree of multi-programming :- Maximum number of processes which can be placed in the RAM in our computer.

Types of operating systems :
----------------------------

1. Batch operating system : It has one CPU and It allows only one processes at a time in RAM.
2. Multi-programming OS   : It has one CPU and It allows more than one processes at a time in RAM.
3. Multi-processesing OS  : It has more than one CPU and it allows only one processes at a time in RAM.

* CPU Efficiency : usefulltime of CPU/ Total time of CPU

Process control block, Attribures of process :
------------------------------------------------

* Passive entity : A program which initiates process.
* Active entity  : process which is initiated by program.

* Stack memory : It will keep track of function calls that happening from process during it's execution.
* Heap Memory  : malloc(), calloc() dynamically allocates this space during process execution.

* Stack space and Heap space is not equal, it may vary based on process.
* Every process has control block.
* Control block : It contains stack memory, Heap memory, static variables & global variables and program  

Attribures of process :

1. Process ID
2. Program counter (nothing but register maintained closer to CPU): It is rensposilble to allocate unfinished process to CPU, to execute from where it stopped.
3. Process state
4. General purpose register : It is used to remember prempted (stopped forcefully from execution by CPU) process register values to complete execution of process by CPU  
5. Priority
6. List of open files  : It is used to remember prempted (stopped forcefully from execution by CPU) process list of open files to complete execution of process by CPU
7. List of open devices : It is used to remember prempted (stopped forcefully from execution by CPU) process list of open devices to complete execution of process by CPU
8. Protection : It makes sure that one process space is not used by other process during execution
