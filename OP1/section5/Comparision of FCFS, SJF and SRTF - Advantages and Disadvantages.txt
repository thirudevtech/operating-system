27. Starvation :
----------------

* Starvation : If there is a chance for a process in the ready state to wait indefinitely to get the CPU.
* Any priority based scheduling algorithm will definitely suffer from the problem of starvation.

28. Convoy effect :
-------------------

* Convoy effect : A smaller process (process with small execution time) waiting for one big process to get off (release) by the CPU.
* An algorithm with convoy effect problem may lead to higher waiting time and higher turn-around time in comparision to an algorithm without convoy effect.

30. Throughput :
----------------

* Throughput : Number of processes executed per unit.
* Throughput : Number of processes executed / schedule length 
* Throughput order : SRTF, SJF, FCFS
