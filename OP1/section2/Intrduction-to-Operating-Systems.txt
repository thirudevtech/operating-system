Introduction to computer systems :
----------------------------------

BOOK : OPERATING SYSTEM PRINCIPLES BY PETER BAER GALVIN 

* program is also called as software
* Process is also called as job 
* combination of hardware, software and data used to solve human problem.
* RAM       : Is used to access program or data by CPU, lost data init if computer restarts.
* Hard-Disk : Is used to store data permanently, CPU takes way longer time to access program or data from it.
* Types of Memory : RAM, Hard-Disk, Cache, registers. 

How Hardware devices work together :  
------------------------------------

* CPU understands machine language 
* All language programs like (java, c#, python etc) are high level language, they needs to convert to manchine language using complier. 
* CPU always reach out to RAM to get program or data to execute, if it does not find info in RAM then a copy should be taken from Hard-Disk to RAM.

Need for operating systems from scratch :
-----------------------------------------

* Long-term scheduler(one of the functionality of operating systems code) is the one which selects the processes from Hard-Disk to RAM.
* Short-term scheduler(one of the functionality of operating systems code) is the one which decides which process should access CPU from RAM.
* Main functionality of operating systems is resource allocation or resource manager.

How input and output devices work together :
--------------------------------------------

* OS code will be there in RAM forever. 
* RAM space is divided into "OS space" and "user space". (OS space contain OS code)
* Buffer means "Memory or space"
* Every I/O device has buffer associated with it.
* CPU contains : "Control unit" and "Arithematic logic unit"
* Execution time and burst time are same. 
* Turn around time = "waiting time" + "burst time" + "i/o time" (these order might br different for different programs)
